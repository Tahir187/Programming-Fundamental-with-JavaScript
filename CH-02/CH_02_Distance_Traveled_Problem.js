// Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the inter-
// state can be calculated with the following formula:
// Distance = Speed * Time
// A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
// • The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
// • The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
// • The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

let speed = 70;
let time1 = 6;
let time2 = 10;
let time3 = 15;

let distance1 = speed * time1;
let distance2 = speed * time2;
let distance3 = speed * time3;

console.log("The distance traveled by car in 6 hours is: ",distance1);
console.log("The distance traveled by car in 10 hours is: ",distance2)
